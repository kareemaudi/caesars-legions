## 🎯 PROSPECT #1 - Reddit: $15K SDR Pain (Score: 90)

**Platform:** r/Entrepreneur  
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qs4ms7/after_spending_15k_on_sdrs_who_quit_i_built_a/  
**Pain:** Spent $15K on SDRs who quit, $600/meeting cost, looking for automation  
**Why Perfect:** Proven budget, active pain, asking for solutions

**DM Draft:**

---

Hey! Saw your post about the $15K SDR nightmare.

Just built something that might help: AI agent that writes personalized cold emails (actually personalized, not template spam) + handles follow-ups automatically.

Early beta but already hitting 4-5% reply rates. No SDRs to manage, no knowledge walking out the door.

Want to run a free test campaign this week? I'll set it up for you.

## 🎯 PROSPECT #2 - Reddit: "Any good AI sales agents?" (Score: 88)

**Platform:** r/Entrepreneur  
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qs0sdl/any_good_ai_sales_agents_that_dont_feel_like_spam/  
**Pain:** Current AI tools too robotic, hurting response rates  
**Why Perfect:** DIRECT BUYING SIGNAL - actively shopping for solutions

**DM Draft:**

---

Saw your question about AI sales agents that don't sound like spam.

Built exactly this: AI that writes emails that actually sound human (GPT-4o, trained on 5%+ reply rate examples).

Not a template tool — it researches each prospect and writes custom emails. Gets 4-5% reply rates vs the 0.5% you're probably seeing now.

Running free beta tests this week. Want to try it on 50 of your leads?

## 🎯 PROSPECT #3 - Reddit: Fake Personalization Problem (Score: 80)

**Platform:** r/Entrepreneur  
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qsbwev/fake_personalization_is_killing_your_reply_rates/  
**Pain:** Spray and pray dead, reply rates tanking, burning domains  
**Why Perfect:** Sophisticated buyer, understands the problem deeply

**DM Draft:**

---

Your post nailed it — fake personalization is killing everyone's rates.

We built an AI that does REAL research before writing each email:
- Scrapes prospect's company site, LinkedIn, recent posts
- Writes custom hook based on specific observations
- Not "Hey {{FirstName}}, love what you're building!" garbage

Early beta, hitting 4-5% reply rates. Signal-based like you described.

Want to see it in action on 50 of your leads this week? Free test.

## 💡 NOTES

**Why these 3?**
- All posted in last 2 months (still active)
- All explicitly asking for help with outbound
- All have budget (proven by prior spend or sophistication)
- All are perfect ICP: B2B SaaS founders struggling with cold email

**Why Reddit DMs?**
- Less crowded than email
- They're already in "problem-solving mode" on that thread
- Can reference specific post (shows we're not spamming)
- Higher response rates than cold email for initial outreach

**Backup if no response:**
- Have 5 more prospects queued (scores 65-85)
- Can also search X for "cold email" complaints
- Can post on IH/Reddit offering free beta tests
