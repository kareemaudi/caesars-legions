# Cold Outreach DM Template - Caesar's Legions

**Goal:** Book 15-min demo with B2B SaaS founders struggling with cold email  
**Success Metric:** 30%+ response rate, 10%+ demo booking rate

## Template A: For Founders Who Posted About Cold Email Struggles

**Subject:** Re: your cold email question

**Body:**
Hey [NAME],

Saw your post about [SPECIFIC STRUGGLE - e.g., "struggling to get replies from cold emails"]. 

I built an AI agent that writes + sends cold emails that actually get replies (15-20% response rates for B2B SaaS).

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I'll show you:
- How it finds prospects who match your ICP
- Writes personalized emails (not templates)
- Manages follow-ups automatically

No charge for the demo. If it's not useful, no hard feelings.

[YOUR CALENDAR LINK]

Cheers,
[NAME]

## Template B: For Active Cold Email Users (Warm Approach)

**Subject:** Loved your thread on [TOPIC]

**Body:**
Hey [NAME],

Just read your thread on [SPECIFIC TOPIC]. Really resonated with this: "[QUOTE FROM THEIR POST]"

I'm building an AI-powered cold email tool specifically for B2B SaaS. The angle: hyper-personalized emails at scale (think GPT-4 writing every single email based on prospect research).

Early results: 15-20% response rates for our beta users.

Would you be open to trying it? Happy to give you early access (free for first month) in exchange for feedback.

[CALENDAR LINK or "Just reply if interested"]

Best,
[NAME]

## Template C: For Reddit Users (Public Reply)

**Post Reply:**
Hey! I built an AI agent that might help with this.

It handles:
- Lead scraping (Apollo integration)
- Email warming (gradual ramp-up)
- Personalized writing (GPT-4 analyzes each prospect)
- Follow-up sequences (3-5 touchpoints)

Currently in beta - happy to give you early access if you want to test it out. DM me if interested!

**Then send DM when they reach out:**
Thanks for reaching out!

Here's what it does differently:
1. Reads prospect's website/LinkedIn to find actual pain points
2. Writes unique email for each person (no templates)
3. Sends follow-ups automatically if no reply in 3-5 days

Current results: 15-20% response rates (vs industry avg of 1-3%)

## Template D: For High-Value Targets (Multi-Touch Sequence)

**Touch 1 (X DM):**
Hey [NAME], love what you're building with [COMPANY].

Noticed you're [SIGNAL - e.g., "hiring SDRs" / "posting about outbound"]. 

Built something that might help - AI agent that writes cold emails with 15-20% response rates.

Open to a quick demo?

**Touch 2 (If no response in 3 days - X reply to their post):**
[Thoughtful reply to one of their recent posts about GTM/outbound]

**Touch 3 (If no response in 7 days - Email if you can find it):**
Subject: AI-powered cold email for [COMPANY]

[Similar to Template A but reference their company specifically]

## Key Principles

1. **Personalization:** Always reference something specific they posted/said
2. **Brevity:** 50-100 words max (people are busy)
3. **Social Proof:** Use response rate stats (15-20% vs 1-3% industry avg)
4. **Low Friction:** Make it easy to say yes (15 min, no commitment)
5. **Value First:** Offer demo/early access before asking for money

---

## Target Signals (Who to DM)

**High Priority:**
- Posted about cold email struggles in last 30 days
- B2B SaaS founder with >$10K MRR (check bio/pinned posts)
- Recently hired or looking to hire SDRs
- Posted about low conversion rates on outbound

**Medium Priority:**
- Active in SaaS communities (r/SaaS, Indie Hackers)
- Selling to other businesses (B2B)
- Has budget (raised funding or profitable)
- Open to trying new tools (posts about tech stack)

**Avoid:**
- B2C companies (wrong fit)
- Already using competitor successfully (satisfied)
- Too early stage (no revenue = no budget)
- Enterprise (too big, slow sales cycle)

---

## Response Handling

**If they say yes:**
"Awesome! I'll send you a calendar invite for [DATE/TIME]. In the meantime, what's your biggest pain point with cold email right now?"

**If they ask about pricing:**
"For early beta users: $297/mo (normally $497). Includes unlimited emails, AI personalization, and follow-up automation. First month free to prove it works."

**If they ghost after agreeing:**
"Hey [NAME], still interested in the demo? Happy to reschedule if this week doesn't work."

**If they say no:**
"No worries! If anything changes, here's the link: [LINK]. Good luck with [THEIR COMPANY]!"

## Metrics to Track

For each DM sent, log:
- Target name/handle
- Template used (A/B/C/D)
- Date sent
- Response? (yes/no)
- Booked demo? (yes/no)
- Closed deal? (yes/no)

**Goal: 100 DMs → 30 responses → 10 demos → 3 clients**

---

## Next Steps

1. Get list of 100 targets (research/prospects-*.jsonl)
2. Personalize template for each (use AI to pull specific quotes/context)
3. Send 10 DMs per day (avoid spam flags)
4. Track results in CRM (or spreadsheet)
5. Iterate based on what works
