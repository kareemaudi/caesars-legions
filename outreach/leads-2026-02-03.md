Hey [Name],

Saw your post about looking for cold email help for [Company].

I run Caesar's Legions - we handle everything: research, writing, sending, follow-ups. 100 emails/week for $497/mo.

Currently onboarding our first 20 clients at founding pricing.

Want me to show you how we'd approach [their ICP]?
