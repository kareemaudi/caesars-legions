# DM Draft: @JeediMindTricks (Rauno Pärna)

**Context:**
- Tweet: "Built a B2B invoicing tool. Cold email failed. Which 1 subreddit got you first users?"
- Pain: Cold email didn't work for him
- Need: Alternative customer acquisition channel
- Perfect fit: Has clear pain point we solve

## DM Version A: Direct Problem-Solution

Hey Rauno,

Saw your tweet about cold email failing for your invoicing tool. 

I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI agents that run cold email campaigns. Since you already tried cold email and it didn't work, I'm guessing the issue was either:
- Generic templates that got ignored
- Poor targeting (wrong ICP)
- Spam filters ate your emails

Want me to run a free pilot campaign for you? 50 personalized emails to your ICP, AI-written for each prospect. You only pay if we book meetings ($50/meeting).

No upfront cost. If it doesn't work, you pay nothing.

Interested?

## DM Version B: Empathy First

Hey Rauno,

"Cold email failed" - I felt that.

Most B2B founders give up after 100 generic emails to a random list. But cold email works when it's:
1. Hyper-targeted (right person, right company, right time)
2. Personalized (not "Hi {firstName}, I noticed...")
3. Value-first (not "Quick question...")

I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI agents that do this at scale. Want to run a free pilot for your invoicing tool? 50 emails, zero upfront cost. You only pay if we book meetings.

Worth a shot?

## DM Version C: Social Proof Angle

Hey Rauno,

Saw you're trying Reddit after cold email didn't work.

Quick thought: Reddit works for early users, but it doesn't scale. Cold email *does* scale - if done right.

I'm building Caesar's Legions (AI-powered cold email) and looking for 3 pilot clients. Free campaign, you only pay per meeting booked ($50 each).

Your invoicing tool sounds like a perfect fit for CFOs at 50-500 person companies. Want me to test that thesis with 50 personalized emails?

## DM Version D: Curiosity Hook

Hey Rauno,

Cold email failed for your invoicing tool?

I'd be curious to see the emails you sent. 9/10 times, the issue is:
- Wrong ICP
- Generic copy
- Bad timing

I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI agents that write personalized cold emails at scale. Want me to run a free pilot? 50 emails, $0 upfront, you only pay per meeting booked.

If it fails again, at least you'll know it's not the channel - it's the market.

## Recommendation: Version B

**Why:**
- Shows empathy (he's frustrated)
- Educates (why cold email failed for him)
- Clear offer (free pilot, pay per result)
- Low friction (easy yes)

**Next Steps:**
1. Get Kareem's approval on DM approach
2. Check if we can actually deliver (need API keys first)
3. Send DM via X
4. Track response in `caesars-legions/outreach/tracker.jsonl`

---

## Supporting Materials Needed

Before sending, prepare:
1. Landing page: caesars-legions.com/pilot
2. Case study deck (even if it's just the concept)
3. Onboarding doc: What we need from client
4. Campaign setup checklist

**Blockers:**
- Need OpenAI API key to actually deliver campaign
- Need Instantly.ai account to send emails
- Need Apollo.io for prospect research

**Workaround:**
- Can send DM now to gauge interest
- While waiting for response, get API keys set up
- If he says yes, we have 24-48h to deliver (time to set up tools)
