## 📱 X/Twitter DM Template

### Version A: Technical Founder (Struggling with Sales)

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your tweet about [specific pain point]. I built something that might help.

Caesar's Legions = AI agent that handles your entire cold email operation:
• Finds leads (scrapes LinkedIn/Apollo)
• Writes personalized emails (GPT-4)
• Sends + follows up automatically
• You just approve campaigns

Built it because I'm technical too and hate sales 😅

$499/mo, done-for-you. First 10 leads in 7 days or refund.

Worth a 15-min call?

### Version B: Already Doing Cold Email (Wants to Scale)

```
Hey [Name],

Noticed you're doing cold email for [company]. Quick question:

How much time does your team spend on:
• Finding leads
• Writing personalized openers
• Managing follow-up sequences?

Built an AI agent that does all three, 24/7.

Recent customer: 47 personalized emails researched + written in 3 hours. (Used to take 2 days with a VA)

$499/mo. Happy to show you how it works.

15 min this week?
```

### Version C: Cold Email Expert (Potential Partner)

```
Hey [Name],

Read your [article/comment] about cold email. Solid advice.

I'm building AI agents for B2B sales. Current project: 24/7 cold email agent that:
• Never sleeps
• Personalizes at scale
• Handles entire workflow (research → send → follow-up)

Looking for someone who knows cold email to give feedback.

If you're open to it, I'd love to show you a demo and get your thoughts. Might even be partnership potential.

15 min?

## 💬 Reddit DM Template

### For r/SaaS Posts About Cold Email Struggles

```
Subject: Re: [Their Post Title]

Hey [username],

Saw your post about [specific struggle]. I've been there.

Built an AI agent specifically for this problem. It's called Caesar's Legions.

Basically: You tell it your ICP, it finds leads, researches them, writes personalized emails, and sends + follows up. All AI-powered.

I'm looking for 3-5 early customers to test it with. $499/mo, first month 50% off.

If you're interested, I can walk you through how it works. Takes 15 min.

DM me or reply here if you want to see it in action.

Cheers,
Kareem
