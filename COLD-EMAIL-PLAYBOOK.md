## How to Book 10 B2B Meetings Without Sounding Spammy

**By Caesar | Caesar's Legions**  
*AI-powered cold email that actually works*

---

## Introduction

Cold email works. You know it does.

But most cold emails are terrible. Spammy, generic, self-centered.

This playbook teaches you how to write cold emails that:
- Get 40%+ open rates
- Generate 5%+ reply rates
- Book 2-5 meetings per 100 emails

In 10 days, you'll go from zero to your first 10 booked meetings.

Let's begin.

---

## Day 1: Define Your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

**Most cold email fails at this step.**

You can't write a good email if you don't know who you're writing to.

### Exercise: Answer These Questions

1. **Who is your ideal customer?**
   - Job title: (e.g., "VP of Sales at B2B SaaS companies")
   - Company size: (e.g., "50-200 employees")
   - Industry: (e.g., "B2B SaaS, fintech, or HR tech")
   - Revenue: (e.g., "$5M-$50M ARR")

2. **What pain do they have that you solve?**
   - Example: "Struggling to scale outbound sales without hiring expensive SDRs"

3. **What makes your solution unique?**
   - Example: "AI-powered cold email that learns from every campaign and improves automatically"

4. **What's the urgency?**
   - Example: "Board expects 3x growth this year, need pipeline NOW"

### Output: One-Sentence ICP

Template:
> "We help [job title] at [company type] who are struggling with [pain] by [unique solution]."

Example:
> "We help VPs of Sales at Series A B2B SaaS companies who are struggling to scale outbound without hiring SDRs by providing AI-powered cold email that books meetings automatically."

## Day 2: Build Your List (50 Prospects)

**Quality > Quantity**

50 perfect prospects beats 5,000 random emails.

### Tools to Use

**Free:**
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (free trial)
- Apollo.io (50 free credits/month)
- Hunter.io (25 free searches/month)

**Paid:**
- Apollo.io ($49/mo for 1,000 credits)
- Instantly.ai ($37/mo unlimited sending)

### How to Build Your List

1. **Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator:**
   - Search by job title + company size + industry
   - Filter by "Posted on LinkedIn in past 30 days" (active users)
   - Save 50 profiles

2. **Enrich with Apollo.io:**
   - Export LinkedIn profiles to CSV
   - Upload to Apollo
   - Enrich with email addresses

3. **Validate Emails:**
   - Use Hunter.io or NeverBounce
   - Remove invalid/catch-all addresses

### Output: Spreadsheet with These Columns

| Name | Title | Company | Email | LinkedIn | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| John Smith | VP Sales | Acme Inc | john@acme.com | linkedin.com/in/johnsmith | Posted about hiring SDRs last week |

---

## Day 3: Research Each Prospect

**This is the secret sauce.**

Most people skip this step. Don't.

### What to Research (5 minutes per prospect)

1. **Check their LinkedIn:**
   - Latest post (what are they talking about?)
   - Recent job change (new role = new priorities)
   - Shared connections (mutual trust)

2. **Check their company:**
   - Recent funding round (urgency + budget)
   - Product launches (growing fast = need sales)
   - Job postings (hiring = pain point)

3. **Find ONE unique thing:**
   - "Saw you posted about X"
   - "Noticed you just raised $10M"
   - "Congrats on the VP promotion"

### Output: Add to Spreadsheet

Add a "Research Note" column with one unique thing per prospect.

---

## Day 4: Write Your Email Template

**Short. Specific. Valuable.**

### The Perfect Cold Email Structure

**Subject Line:**
- [Their name], quick question about [pain]
- Example: "John, quick question about SDR hiring"

**Body (4 lines max):**

```
Line 1: Reference unique thing
"Saw you posted about struggling to hire SDRs."

Line 2: State the pain/opportunity
"Most B2B SaaS VPs waste 6+ months hiring/training SDRs only to get mediocre results."

Line 3: Your solution (1 sentence)
"We help companies like [similar company] book 20+ qualified meetings/month using AI-powered cold email - no SDRs needed."

Line 4: CTA (question, not meeting ask)
"Curious if this would work for Acme?"
```

**That's it. 75 words max.**

### What NOT to Do

❌ "I hope this email finds you well..."  
❌ Talk about your company history  
❌ List 10 features  
❌ Ask for 30-minute call  
❌ Use buzzwords ("leverage", "synergy", "cutting-edge")  

### What TO Do

✅ Reference something specific about them  
✅ State their pain clearly  
✅ One-sentence solution  
✅ Ask a question (not request a meeting)  

---

## Day 5: Send First 10 Emails

**Start small. Learn fast.**

### How to Send

**Option 1: Manually (Recommended for first batch)**
- Use Gmail/Outlook
- Personalize each email
- Send 1-2 per hour (avoid spam filters)

**Option 2: Automation (After testing manually)**
- Use Instantly.ai or Smartlead
- Set up sequences
- Warm up your domain first (crucial!)

### Tracking

Use a simple spreadsheet:

| Name | Sent Date | Opened? | Replied? | Meeting Booked? | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| John Smith | Jan 1 | Yes | No | No | Opened but no reply |

### Success Metrics

After 10 emails:
- **Open rate >40%** = Good subject line ✅
- **Reply rate >5%** = Good targeting ✅
- **Positive replies >2%** = Good offer ✅

If any metric is below target, iterate before sending more.

---

## Day 6-8: Follow Up

**80% of replies come from follow-ups.**

Most people send 1 email and give up. Don't.

### Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3 Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Hey [Name],

Saw you opened my email. Curious if [solution] resonates?

Happy to send over a quick case study (we helped [similar company] book 15 meetings in 3 weeks).

- [Your name]
```

**Day 5 Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

[Name],

Last email - if not interested, no worries!

If timing's just off, when should I check back?

- [Your name]
```

**Day 7 Follow-Up (Breakup Email):**
```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

[Name],

Taking you off my list since I haven't heard back.

Before I do: Is this just not a priority right now, or am I targeting the wrong person?

(If it's the latter, who should I talk to instead?)

- [Your name]
```

**The breakup email gets the most replies.** Human psychology.

---

## Day 9: Analyze Results

**Data > opinions.**

### Metrics to Track

After 50 emails + follow-ups:

1. **Open Rate** (should be >40%)
   - If low: Test different subject lines
   
2. **Reply Rate** (should be >5%)
   - If low: Improve targeting or personalization
   
3. **Positive Reply Rate** (should be >2%)
   - If low: Improve offer/value prop
   
4. **Meeting Booking Rate** (should be >1%)
   - If low: Improve CTA or qualification

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Low open rate | Test subject lines, send at different times |
| High open, low reply | Bad targeting (wrong people) or bad offer |
| Lots of "not interested" | Unclear value prop, improve Line 3 |
| Opens but no replies | Email too long, add clearer CTA |
| Spam folder | Warm up domain, reduce volume, improve copy |

---

## Day 10: Scale or Pivot

### If It's Working (>2% meeting rate):

**Scale:**
- Send to 50 more prospects
- A/B test subject lines
- Build email sequences (2-3 follow-ups)
- Consider automation (Instantly.ai)

**Goal:** 100 emails/week = 2-4 meetings/week = 8-16 meetings/month

### If It's NOT Working (<1% meeting rate):

**Pivot:**

1. **Change ICP** - Target different persona/industry
2. **Change Message** - Test new pain points
3. **Change Offer** - Free audit? Case study? Different hook?
4. **Change Channel** - Maybe cold email isn't the answer (try LinkedIn, cold calling, content)

**Don't give up. Iterate.**
